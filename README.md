# Bonsai Buddy

A web app I created for myself to aid in easily outputing the most crucial aspects of maintaining a bonsai tree.
This is achieved by using the OpenAI API and crafting a prompt to "only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON response
following this format without deviation."

## Future additions

- User log-in interface w/ authentication.
- Location based water reminder based on your local weather forcast.
- Track progress of your tree with image upload.
